    comment: `Im glad to write a feedback about Gokul who was once my junior collegue and then turned into a little brother.From the very beginning, despite high pressure and opposition from those around him, he chose to follow his passion not in the field others expected of him, but in what truly spoke to his heart the world of IT.His decision to step away from the path of a medical career, in pursuit of something that genuinely made him happy, is a testament to his courage and inner strength. He not only persevered through those challenging times but has now built a successful and fulfilling career in the IT field. His joy and passion for his work are evident in everything he does.On a personal level, Gokul is incredibly soft hearted, polite, and always ready to help others. His high level of empathy and willingness to support those in need make him a genuinely wonderful human being. It is rare to find someone like this in this generation .Gokul continues to be an inspiration to everyone around him, showing that staying true to yourself, even when it’s difficult, can lead to true happiness and success.I have refered his life story to many who asked me about switching the field they choose for future in the name of passion.`,

    comment: `Working alongside Gokul Sujan has been a truly rewarding experience, as he consistently brought strong backend development skills and a high level of professionalism to the team. Gokul possesses a deep understanding of backend systems, particularly in Java and the Spring Boot framework, and applies that knowledge effectively to deliver robust, scalable, and efficient solutions. What truly sets him apart is his sense of ownership—he takes full responsibility for the tasks at hand, ensuring they are completed with high quality and within timelines. His proactive attitude enables him to anticipate potential challenges early and address them before they escalate. Gokul is also a remarkably fast learner; he quickly grasps new concepts, tools, and technologies, and integrates them seamlessly into his work. His professionalism, technical skills, and team-first mentality make him an invaluable contributor to any development team, and I have no doubt he will continue to excel in any environment he chooses to be a part of.`,
